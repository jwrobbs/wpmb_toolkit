# WPMB Toolkit

**_In development. Not ready for anything._**

An extensible toolkit for WordPress devs and webmasters.

## Problem solved

I often have a million little unrelated tweaks I want to make to a website.

What do you do?

- Create a million tiny plugins?
- Dump them all in 1 plugin?

I'm a proud member of team "dump them in 1 plugin". The toolkit is being build to formalize and streamline that process. It's a mini plugin manager.

- Install only the tools you want
- Enable/disable tools
- Requirements system
- Shared, streamline options page generator built on Custom Fields

## Testing

There are currently no tests.

But there are stubs for Carbon Fields. It uses dynamic methods and VS Code can't handle that. Add the stubs folder to your Intelephense folder and you'll be off to the races.
